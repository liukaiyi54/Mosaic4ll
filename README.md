# Mosaic4ll

This was designed to create a mosaic style image using small tiles.
> small tiles mean small images cropped from other images.

Example as below. A stunning picture of my good-looking little sister. You will find that this picture was actually composed by many of her other pictures, if you enlarge it. Pretty amazing, huh？And the most amazing part is that I didn't change any of the original colors of those smaller pictuers. So you're welcome to make compliments to me, but mostly to my good-looking sister.
