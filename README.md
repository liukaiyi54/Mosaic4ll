# Mosaic4ll

This was designed to create a mosaic style image using small tiles.
> small tiles mean small images cropped from other images.

Example as below. A stunning picture of my good-looking little sister. You will find that this picture was actually composed by many of her other pictures, if you enlarge it. Pretty amazing, huh？
